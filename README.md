## 0x00-ES6_basic
- JavaScript ES6 (also known as ECMAScript2015 or ECMAScript6) is the sixth edition of JavaScript introduced in June 2015. ECMAScript (European Computer Manufacturers Association Script) is the standard specification of JavaScript to ensure compatibility in all browsers and environments.

## 0x01-ES6_promise
- An ES6 Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing you to handle success and error cases in a more manageable way.

## 0x02-ES6_classes
- ES6 classes provide a syntactical sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance, allowing you to create and manage objects using a more familiar, class-based structure similar to other programming languages.

## 0x03-ES6_data_manipulation
- ES6 data manipulation refers to the use of modern JavaScript features like destructuring, spread/rest operators, and higher-order array methods (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) to efficiently manage and transform data.

## 0x04-TypeScript
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enabling developers to catch errors at compile time and write more robust, maintainable code.
